Step 1 Create a reverse resolution resource record.
Bind provides the administrator with a template file for configuring resource records. The
file is stored in the /var/named directory and named named.loopback. Run the cp
command to copy the file as 192.168.1.zone. The details are as follows:
cd /var/named
cp named.loopback 192.168.1.zone -p
After the copy is complete, modify the configurations in 192.168.1.zone as follows:

$TTL 1D
@ IN SOA master.test.com. admin.test.com. (
 0 ; serial
 1D ; refresh
 1H ; retry
1W ; expire
3H ) ; minimum
 NS master
master A 192.168.1.13
12 PTR www.test.com
