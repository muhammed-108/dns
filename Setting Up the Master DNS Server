Step 1 Create a forward resolution resource record.
Bind provides the administrator with a template file for configuring resource records. The
file is stored in the /var/named directory and named named.localhost. Run the cp
command to copy the file as test.com.zone. The details are as follows:
cd /var/named
cp named.localhost test.com.zone -p
After the copy is complete, modify the configurations in test.com.zone as follows:
$TTL 1D
@ IN SOA master.test.com. admin.test.com. (
 0 ; serial
1D ; refresh
1H ; retry
1W ; expire
3H ) ; minimum
 NS master
master A 192.168.1.13
www CNAME main
main A 192.168.1.12


Step 2 Modify the configurations.
Modify the listening port and permission configurations in the /etc/named.conf
configuration file of the DNS service, as shown in the following figure.


dwatr la file /etc/named.rfc1913.zones
ama zyad bka

zone "test.com" IN {
 type master;
 file "test.come.zone";
};

dwatr check akaitawa ba named-checkconf
dwatr named-checkzone test.com /var/named/text.com.zone

inja reload rndc reload

Step 3 Verify the configurations.
On the VM of the NGINX server, run the following commands (change ens33 in the
commands as required) to point the DNS server address to the newly configured server:
nmcli con mod ens33 ipv4.dns 192.168.1.13
nmcli con down ens33 && nmcli con up ens33
To ensure the lab effect, manually set the DNS server address of the VPC where the ECS
resides to 192.168.1.13, as shown in the following figure.

After the configuration is complete, run the nslookup command to check whether the
DNS service can correctly resolve www.test.com to 192.168.1.12, as shown in the
following figure.

Run the curl command to access www.test.com, as shown in the following figure.
